          <h3>Project Goal</h3>
          <p>Currently, 3D image registration is done with an optimization process, which is slow. Because the database of brain MRI scans is so large, the transformations can be memorized by a machine given the shape of a given brain. The goal is to speed this process up with a convolutional nerual networks so the process becomes one step instead of iterative, speeding up the process.

        <p>Used machine learning to classify 1D radar chirp emitters with an autoencoder neural network in TensorFlow. Fine tuned neural networks, and improved data preprocessing to increase accuracy and prevent over-fitting on classes with limited data. Scripted in python and bash, running code on AWS.

          <p>My work with the company was entirely building and perfecting a single model to classify radar emitters; even when those radars emitted signals that were different frequencies, frequency patterns, time lengths, and bandwidths. </p>
          <h3>Architecture Description</h3>

          <p>The architecture involved taking FFT's of the data, doing a couple convolutional filters on groups of them, and then inputting each FFT into a long short-term memory network (LSTM), one per time step. The LSTM states then learned how to interpret the signals. The output of the the LSTM is trained with an autoencoder, with the loss being the comparison with the original signal. Then, then network is trained by attaching the LSTM to several dense neural network layers. The network was able to achieve >95% test accuracy on the emitter classification.
          </p>
          <p>This is the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tsne) viewing of the training data for the encodings of the dozen radar emitter classes. The data looks relatively separable. </p>

          <p>This is the tsne of the test data. The encoder does not overfit, as the two look very similar.</p>

          <h3>Cognitive radar classification</h3>
          <p>Researched and wrote an image/signal processing program to recognize enemy radar chirps in electronic warfare. The program receives a radar signal, transforms it into a spectrogram image, then filters that image and applies computer vision techniques to create recognizable features. A machine learning neural net then uses the processed image to classify incoming radar as different adversaries. Wrote and tested the program in C++ for industrial use after testing concepts in MATLAB.
